# 🦹‍♀️ Lua Types 

Just typing for scripts

> Written for [sumneko.lua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) extension for VSCode (install it before do anything)

## 👀 How to

- Clone repository somewhere
- Open folder with scripts in VSCode
- At root create `.vscode/settings.json` file with next content:
  ```json
  {
    "Lua.workspace.library": ["PATH_TO_CLONNED_REPOSITORY"]
  }
  ```
